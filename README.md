## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure that you have installed:

- Node.js and npm
- MongoDB Atlas account or a compatible MongoDB setup
- Git
- Docker and Docker Compose (optional)

## Installation and Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sunil152005/Smart_Lead_Dashboard.git
cd Smart_Lead_Dashboard
```

### 2. Set Up the Backend

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Configure the environment variables using the provided `.env.example` file. Add the required MongoDB connection string and other variables expected by the backend configuration.

Build and start the backend:

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

The backend is expected to run at:

`http://localhost:5000`

Health check:

`http://localhost:5000/api/health`

### 3. Set Up the Frontend

Open a second terminal from the project root:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the frontend in your browser:

`http://localhost:5173`

**Note:** Ensure that the environment variables, scripts, and API configuration match the current project files.

## Running with Docker

If Docker and Docker Compose are installed, run the following command from the project root:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

The application is configured to use the following local addresses:

- Frontend: `http://localhost:5173`
- Backend: `http://localhost:5000`

## Demo Accounts

The original project documentation provides the following demo accounts:

| Role | Email | Password |
|---|---|---|
| Admin Manager | `rahul@gmail.com` | `123456` |
| Sales Representative | `priya@sales.com` | `123456` |

Use these credentials only if the demo accounts are available in your current application environment. Change or remove publicly documented demo credentials if they provide access to a shared or production database.

## Security Considerations

- Passwords are hashed using bcryptjs.
- JWT authentication protects restricted routes.
- Role-based authorization limits sensitive operations.
- Environment variables should be used for database credentials and secrets.
- Never commit `.env` files, database credentials, JWT secrets, or private access tokens.
- Demo credentials should not be reused in production environments.

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements include:

- Email notifications for lead updates.
- Advanced reporting and analytics.
- Lead assignment and team collaboration.
- Automated follow-up reminders.
- Integration with external communication tools.
- Expanded automated testing and monitoring.
